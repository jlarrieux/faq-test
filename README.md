# MakerDAO FAQs

This is the main repository for the MakerDao FAQs and should be considered the canonical source of truth for user facing documents in the ecosystem.

We'd like to avoid fragmentation and staleness so please don't copy content from here if you could add this repo to your build process instead.

## Workflow
Should look like this:

* New documents are added to `draft` branch
* Completed drafts are merged to `review` branch
* Pull requests from `review` to `master` require sign-off by relevant stakeholders
* Anything that lands in `master` is pulled into various apps. Consider `master` a deploy to prod(s)

Please see the Style Guide for general tips for naming conventions and tone.

## Updates/Errors/Suggestions
Please submit an issue if you find a problem.
